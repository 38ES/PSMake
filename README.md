What is it?
Who would want it?
What problem does it solve?
How can I work with you?  (aka Is there a team, chat, channel, forum, etc. you hang out in?  Or do I just email you?  or make issues, discussion here)  -- A contributing.md would be great :)
Contributors (I think there's a way to automatically list contributors)
What's next?
